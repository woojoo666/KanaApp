Kana Study App
==============

This was a simple mobile HTML app I made while studying Hiragana. At the time, all the apps I used to test my hiragana memorization used multiple choice, but the relative similarity of certain hiragana made me confused. To avoid this issue, my app "says" the word for you to write it out, avoiding the confusion of seeing multiple hiragana at once.

Test Mode
---------
In the main menu, click "Start Menu" to go to the testing page. Here, you listen for the audio, write what you think is the corresponding hiragana in the box (stroke order matters!), and then two-finger-tap to check your answer. After you see your result, two-finger-tap to move onto the next hiragana. Note that the very first hiragana is always „ÅÇ, so write that in the box and two-finger-tap to begin the actual test, where each subsequent hiragana will be chosen at random.

Results Page
--------------
In the main menu, click "Results" to see your progress. There are two views, "Characters" and "Percentages" (which can be chosen from the options at the top of the Results page).

**Characters:** The smaller the hiragana, the higher your ratio of correct attempts to total attempts.

**Percentages:** Displays the numerical percentage of correct/total attempts, and buttons to reset statistics for individual hiragana.

Settings page

Adjust the volume, or reset all results.
